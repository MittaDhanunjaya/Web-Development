<h1>Love</h1>
<p class="Ammudu">Love is a variety of different feelings, states,
and attitudes that ranges from interpersonal affection (<mona>"I love my mother"</mona>) to pleasure ("I loved that meal").
Ancient Greek philosophers identified four forms of love: kinship or familiarity (in Greek, storge), friendship (philia), <span>romantic desire (eros)</span>, 
and self-emptying or unconditional love (agape)</p>
<h1>War</h1>
<p class="kummudu">
War is a state of armed conflict between societies. An absence of war is usually called "peace". 
Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.
